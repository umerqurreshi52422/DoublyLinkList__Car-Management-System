    Deletion of a car from the front or end of the linked list.
    Displaying the details of all the cars in the linked list.

The program also maintains a separate linked list of all the cars that have been sold, and allows the user to view the details of all the sold cars.

Note: This program uses the Windows.h header file to change the text color of the console output. If you are using a non-Windows system, you may need to modify the code to remove this dependency.stem
